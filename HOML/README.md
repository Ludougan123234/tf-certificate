# About this folder

This folder contains notes and exercise solutions for chapters 10 - 19 of the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-learn, Keras & Tensorflow" by Aurélien Géron. The notes consists of the original code in the notebooks forked from [this repository](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) with slight modifications as well as my own notes taken in the Markdown format. The notes only cover the content and the extra readings listed in the book.
